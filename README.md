# Nuance - Be Bold
This is a tool I intially developped in order to achieve platform-independent text editing capabilities from within chromium based browsers, which has evolved into a unicode multitool for convenient browser based non-standard input transormation.
This tool will allow you to send bold and italic text even in web applications where formal text editing is restricted and markdown is not available. This is achieved by using unicode character equivalent substitution instead of traditional bold and italic character transforms.
Almost all systems are capable of rendering the bold and italic text generated by this extension. The tool's capabilities have been extended to produce interesting unicode substitutions and insertions on demand.
