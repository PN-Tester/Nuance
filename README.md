  # Nuance - Be Bold
This is a tool I developped in order to achieve platform-independent text editing capabilities from within chromium based browsers. This tool will allow you to send bold and italic text even in web applications where 
formal text editing is restricted and markdown is not available. This is achieved by using unicode character equivalent substitution instead of traditional bold and italic character transforms.
Almost all systems are capable of rendering the bold and italic text generated by this extension.
